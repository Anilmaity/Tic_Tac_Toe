# Tic Tac Toe Game

# Assignment | Full Stack Developer

## Description

Tech stack used for this assignment is React for Frontend and Django for Backend. While the communication is done using GraphQL.


## Usage

Frontend URL: https://tictactoeapp-z3ih4o4xwq-el.a.run.app/

Backend URL: https://tictactoe-z3ih4o4xwq-el.a.run.app/

As mentioned in the task, app has been developed by keeping the mobile design in mind.

Flow of UI is kept as intended

- User has to register first
- Once "registered successful" popup is displayed, user can use the same credentials to login the game.
- After login a user can start a new game, 
- If he played games before with friends those friends can be visible in the home screen
- He can choose to play with old friends or add new ones.
- Tic Tac Toe game flow works as expected


## Architecture

- ReactJS is used for frontend, since it was one of the key requirements of the task
- Django for backend, as I have worked with Django before and it is easy to use.
- GraphQL for communication, as its fast and easy to use than REST API
- Docker used for containerize frontend webapp and backend so that they can be easily deplyed on Google Cloud.
- Postgres database is used for storage
- Entire project is hosted on Google Cloud, as I have worked with it

## Assumption

- That the game will be primarily used on mobile devices.

## Problems Faced

- Faced issue while deploying backend due to some dependency issues. It was fixed later
