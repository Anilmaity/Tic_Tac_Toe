# Tic Tac Toe Game

An asynchronous multiplayer Tic Tac Toe game

We all have played Tic Tac Toe at some point in our life so we will not go deeper into the basic rules of it (if you are not aware of the game, please Google for 3x3 Tic Tac Toe Game)

We’ll build an asynchronous multi-player version of the same game. This broadly includes - 

→ A mobile web frontend
→ An API backend with a database
